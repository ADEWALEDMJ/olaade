        <p>This story continues on directly after my previous story, Two Fridays – Part 1.


In the morning I woke up, and wondered if it had all been a dream. My come-stained shirt, lying in the corner near the head of my bed, where I had tossed it before getting in, showed one thing- the part about wanking myself was certainly true, but what about the rest? I showered and put on fresh clothes for the day, and a short time later, Tina came to join me at breakfast, straight from her bed, and wearing her nightie and brunch coat.

Although as usual, we talked and chattered over breakfast, Tina said nothing about last night, which suggested to me that maybe I just dreamt it, but it all seemed so real. Then, if it was real, and Tina showed no sign it ever happened, that probably meant she was ashamed, and it certainly meant it wasn’t going to happen again. I thought it was best not to bring the subject up, unless Tina did it first.

I noticed that, straight after breakfast, and before she even had a shower, Tina stripped her bed and took her sheets to the laundry, putting them straight in the washing machine, but even that wasn’t unusual for her. Our mother was still having her Saturday morning sleep-in, and as Tina walked from the laundry, our eyes met, but she said nothing out of the ordinary.

The entire weekend went by, with no hint of anything from Tina, but a couple of times when her door was shut, I had to wonder if she was in there, touching herself like she had done for me, pleasuring herself the way she had done on Friday night, and my throat would go dry, and that familiar need to take matters in hand would make itself known. I masturbated twice that Sunday without using a porn magazine for inspiration, just re-running the events of Friday night in my head.

Monday, of course, was a school day, and after school, Tina and I caught the same bus home as usual, but when we got off at our stop, I saw Tina walking with Katy in the direction of Katy’s house. I went home and changed into some shorts and a casual shirt, did a little half-hearted work on a school assignment due later in the week, and then watched some TV.

Tina came in the back door, about an hour after I got home, still in her school uniform, and as soon as she walked into the family room, she said, “Look at this.” She reached into her school backpack, took out a DVD case, and handed it to me. I could see straight away it was a porn movie, and the title on the front was Heatwave at Station 69. There was a picture on the front, of a busty, bare-breasted blonde girl, wearing an open fireman’s jacket over stockings, suspenders and white lace panties, and holding the metal end of a firehose, the way a girl would hold a man’s cock when she was giving him a hand job. I turned it over and on the back there were some stills from the movie, and it said, Things heat up all over when a charm school for young ladies opens up next door to a Louisiana fire station. Polish your helmet and you can come, too. Let’s all go for a ride-along with these good old boys and their southern belles

“Where’d you get that?” I said, handing it back to Tina. I couldn’t help smiling.

“Katy,” she answered, cheerfully, “She was snooping around in her father’s bedside table and found it in the drawer with some other ones. She didn’t think he’d notice if she borrowed one for a few days.”

“What are you gonna do with it?” I asked, chuckling.

“Watch it, Dickhead. What do you normally do with movies?” Tina smiled, “When Mum’s not home, of course.” She took the DVD, and went to her room, and came out a few minutes later with some jeans and a pink top on, and watched TV with me until our mother came home from work.

The week went by, and almost before I knew it, Friday night came around again. I forgot all about the porn DVD, and as usual on a Friday night, after cooking us our dinner, our mother got dolled up and left in a taxi to go and meet her unofficial boyfriend, Steve. I don’t know why, but for some reason, although she had him over a few times, and he got on okay with Tina and me, she never let him stay the night, and didn’t like anyone referring to him as her boyfriend. Women can be strange sometimes.

Tina was wearing a short skirt, made of white denim, and a cream coloured top, with short sleeves and a square neckline that showed some of her modest cleavage, and her hair was in its usual ponytail. We sat and watched some comedy shows on TV, and then after they ended, I looked at the TV guide, to see if there was anything worth watching. One channel had a rerun of Dirty Dancing, but I’d seen that at least half a dozen times, and there was nothing interesting on any of the other channels.

Tina came in from the kitchen and said, “What’s on?”

“Crap,” I said, “Dirty Dancing is on but not much else.”

“Patrick Swayze’s a hunk, but I’ve seen it so many times I can practically recite the script,” Tina said, without much interest. She sat on the couch next to me, and said, “Hey, let’s watch that dirty movie.” She was smiling, a little mischievously.

“Okay,” I smiled. I’d forgotten about it, but Tina got up and went down the hall to her room, and came back a minute later. When she bent to put the DVD in the player, I caught a glimpse of pink cotton panties under her short skirt.</p>
